In Machine Learning we assume that there exists a pattern in data which cannot be pinned down mathematically but can be learnt.
The learning happens over a set of hypothesis functions (H) and the outcome is a final hypothesis function(h) that is nearly similar
to the target function (t). The target function (t) is an unknown function that represents the exact mapping in the data (D).
