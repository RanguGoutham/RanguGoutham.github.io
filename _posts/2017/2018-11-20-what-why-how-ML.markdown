In Machine Learning we assume 
- A pattern exists which cannot be pinned down mathematically, which can be learnt using data.
A target function 't' can map an input to an output and a hypothesis function 'g' (from a given hypothesis set 'H') 
tries to do the best mapping by learning the patterns present in the data.
