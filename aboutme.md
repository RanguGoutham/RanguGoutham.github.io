I am an intern at MTR lab in Nokia Technologies. My work focuses on deep learning for computer vision.\\
\\
My interests form a broad range of topics in which i try to understand a droplet of information day by day.\\
I have some issues remembering stuff(verbal) so I finally thought to blog them down, so i look back to  them whenever and wherever i want to.\\
